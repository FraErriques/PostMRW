Please create a file called LogSinkFsConfig.txt just in the directory where you find the current file. Then fill it as follows:
key_logFullPathPrefix PARAGRAPH NAME (the first three rows are an index of the contents, they work as a memo)
key_semaphore PARAGRAPH NAME (paragraph names and their order is compulsive) 
key_verbosity PARAGRAPH NAME NB the delimiter compulsory char is one between {blank, TAB, '', '
' .logFullPathPrefix ACTUAL VALUE (the second three rows contain the actual contents of the paragraphs announced in the index)
semaphore ACTUAL VALUE (the order of the contents must respect the order in the index)
verbosity ACTUAL VALUE n in [0..99] means levels from current verbosity up will be written: if I set verbosity==3, messages of level=2 will not be written
